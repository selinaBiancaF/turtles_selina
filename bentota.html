        <h1>Bentota Turtle Hatchery</h1>
         <br>
    <p>The Bentota turtle hatchery begins by keeping a watch on the nesting mother turtles,
         delivering their eggs to the safe environment of the hatchery, and then, on the day 
         of the young turtles' birth, releasing them into the sea.
        If there are complications, however, they typically deal with them and only
         release them when they are well enough to enter the big ocean.

    <p>The main aim of the project is to conserve the sea turtles and protect them from predators like birds, dogs, and crabs.
     It is one of the 18 hatcheries in Sri Lanka devoted to the proper breeding of this endangered species.
      Visitors can get to see up to five endangered species out of seven species of margin turtles in the world here.
       The place is especially suitable for kids but provides to be a once in a lifetime experience for all.

    The volunteers patrol the beach at night to make sure that any mother turtles have proper conditions to lay eggs.
     They also carry the eggs back to the hatchery to make sure they hatch properly without any harm from predators and 
     then release the baby sea turtles back into the ocean once properly hatched. They also take care of sea turtles with disabilities and treat the ones who have become weak due to fishing activities.
    
    Tourists will be guided throughout the process of protecting and proper hatching of the sea turtles while
     visiting the hatchery. One can also visit the hatchery in the evening when the baby turtles are released into
      the sea as the risk for predators is minimum at this time and get the opportunity to release their baby sea turtle into the sea.
