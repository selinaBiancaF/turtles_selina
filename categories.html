            <h1>Green Turtle</h1>
            <span></span>
          <p>The green turtle is one of the largest sea turtles and 
            the only herbivore among the different species.
             Green turtles are in fact named for the greenish color of
              their cartilage and fat, not their shells. Green turtles are
         found mainly in tropical and subtropical waters. Like other sea turtles, 
            they migrate long distances between feeding grounds and the beaches from where they hatched.
         Classified as endangered, green turtles are threatened by overharvesting of their eggs, 
         hunting of adults, being caught in fishing gear and loss of nesting beach sites.
         Seagrass beds and related microhabitats are thought to benefit from these turtles' presence.
          They will graze the beds, removing the tips of the leaf blades while avoiding the roots.
           With a daily trim, the seagrass will grow quicker and healthier! 
           Some green turtles in the Eastern Pacific are categorized as Pacific black turtles, 
           although some scientists think they may really be a different species rather than
            the subspecies they are now recognized to be. Though they are not black in color, 
            they look darker overall because their skin pigmentation is deeper than that of other green turtles. 
            Additionally, they are smaller, and the form of their carapace is a little different.

            <h1>Hawskbill Turtle</h1>
            <span></span>
          <p>Hawksbills are named for their narrow, pointed beak.
            They also have a distinctive pattern of overlapping scales
           on their shells that form a serrated-look on the edges.
            These colored and patterned shells make them highly-valuable and commonly sold as "tortoiseshell" in markets.
           Hawksbills are found mainly throughout the world's tropical oceans, 
           predominantly in coral reefs. They feed mainly on sponges by using their
            narrow pointed beaks to extract them from crevices on the reef, 
            but also eat sea anemones and jellyfish. Sea turtles are the living 
           representatives of a group of reptiles that has existed on Earth and travelled our seas for the last 100 million years. 
           They are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems and help maintain the health of coral reefs and sea grass bed.</p>
           
           <p>Hawksbills help maintain the health of coral reefs.
            As they remove prey such as sponges from the reef's surface,
           they provide better access for reef fish to feed. 
           They also have cultural significance and tourism value. 
            For example, for local residents in the Coral Triangle,
            the flow of visitors who come to admire turtles is a vital source of income.

            <h1>Loggerhead Turtle</h1>
            <span></span>
          <p>Loggerhead turtles are named for their large heads that support powerful jaw muscles, 
            allowing them to crush hard-shelled prey like clams and sea urchins.
         They are less likely to be hunted for their meat or shell compared to other sea turtles.
          Bycatch, the accidental capture of marine animals in fishing gear, 
          is a serious problem for loggerhead turtles because they frequently come in contact with fisheries.
        </p>
        <p>Loggerheads are the most common turtle in the Mediterranean,
          nesting on beaches from Greece, Turkey , Israel ,Libya and Sri Lanka.
           Many of their nesting beaches are under threat from tourism development.
            Sea turtles are the living representatives of a group of reptiles 
            that has existed on Earth and travelled our seas for the last 100 million years.

            <h1>Leatherback Turtle</h1>
            <span></span>
          <p>Leatherback turtles are named for their shell, 
            which is leather-like rather than hard, like other turtles.
            They are the largest sea turtle species and also one of the most migratory,
             crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
              Pacific leatherbacks migrate from nesting beaches 
              in the Coral Triangle all the way to the California coast 
              to feed on the abundant jellyfish every summer and fall.
            </p>
          <p>Although their distribution is wide, 
            numbers of leatherback turtles have seriously declined during the last century as a 
            result of intense egg collection and fisheries bycatch. 
            Globally, leatherback status according to IUCN is listed 
            as Vulnerable, but many subpopulations 
            (such as in the Pacific and Southwest Atlantic) are Critically Endangered.

            <span></span>
          <p>The name for this sea turtle is tied to the color 
            of its shellâ€”an olive green hue. They are currently
             the most abundant of all sea turtles. Their vulnerable
              status comes from the fact that they nest in a very
               small number of places, and therefore any disturbance 
            to even one nest beach could have huge repercussions on
            the entire population.
