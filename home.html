                        <p>Turtle hatcheries provides a sanctuary to turtle eggs and injured turtles; by rehabilitating
                            them.
                            To protect the population of turtles that visit the shores to nest, the hatchery collects
                            and safeguards
                            the eggs within their premises until they are ready to hatch and make their way back home to
                            the big blue.</p>

                        <h1>Sea Turtles in Sri Lanka</h1>
                        <p>Sri Lankan waters are home to five ot of the seven different kinds of sea turtles. All of
                            which run the risk of going extinct unless precautions are taken.
                            Sea turtles in Sri Lanka are regarded as a national treasure. The southern beaches
                            of the island are frequently visited by the five species of sea turtles found in
                            Sri Lankan waters: the Green, Leatherback, Olive Ridley, Loggerhead,
                            and Hawksbill.</p>
                            <P>Although sea turtles spend the majority of their lives in
                            the water, they periodically come ashore to deposit their eggs.
                            From Mount Lavinia, along the west coast, south coast, and up to Arugam Bay on
                            the east coast of Sri Lanka, their regional nesting sites extend.</p>

                        <h1>When do turtles visit the shores of Sri Lanka?</h1>

                        <p>Green turtles nest all year round in Sri Lanka, with the highest abundance reported
                            in Kosgoda (north of Galle) and Rekawa (near Tangalle).
                            The best time to see them nest is between January and March.</p>
                            <p> Another of the most common turtles seen in Sri Lanka are the Olive Ridley
                            which appear in large numbers during their nesting seasons between September
                            and November and November and January respectively. Olive Ridley’s have been
                            sighted just about everywhere along Sri Lanka’s coast. Loggerhead, Leatherback
                            and Hawksbill turtles are more rare to sight in Sri Lanka; the first being more common
                            to the East Coast of America and the latter two being on the critically endangered list,
                            driven there by the tortoise shell trade. Leatherbacks and Hawksbill turtles are most likely
                            to be seen around Bentota while Loggerheads have been spotted along Kosgoda and Rekawa.
