    <p>
        The Kosgoda turtle hatchery start with keeping an eye on the nesting mother turtles,
        bringing their eggs to the secure environment of the hatchery and
        finally releasing the baby turtles into the sea on the day of their birth.
        However, if there are complications, they tend to them and release them only once they’re
        fit to go into the vast ocean.</p>

<p>The females get themselves onto the sand above the high tide line
    after mating in the water. The number of eggs laid every litter varies 
    on the age of the female. Once she has found a good nesting location, 
    the gravid female digs a hole with her rear flippers. The female covers
     the nest with sand after laying the eggs.
   Throughout the year, different populations have different mating seasons.
     Every two to four years, a female green turtle typically mates. But the period 
     from January to March sees an uptick. Male turtles cannot compel female turtles to mate; 
     female turtles regulate mating. Hatchling survival is higher, although only a small number of 
     green turtle populations are known to mate in polyandry.
   The females get themselves onto the sand above the high tide line after mating in the water.
    The number of eggs laid every litter varies on the age of the female. Once she has found a good nesting location,
     the gravid female digs a hole with her rear flippers. The female covers the nest with sand after laying the eggs.
   Eggs have a fragile shell and are globular. Each nest has 98–172 eggs that are 41.4–42.1mm in diameter.
    Approximately two months later, the hatchlings appear. One female can make up to 11 nests in a nesting season.
     The eggs open at night, and the hatchling turtles instinctively swim straight for the water's edge.
      Turtles spend the majority of their early life stages in convergence zones in the open ocean for the first five years after hatching.
